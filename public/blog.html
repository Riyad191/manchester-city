                In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group
                for £210 million and received considerable financial investment
                in both playing staff and club facilities, including the £150
                million Etihad Campus in east Manchester.[5] Under the
                management of Pep Guardiola they won the Premier League in 2018
                becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a
                single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an
                unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and
                becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic
                treble.[6] Manchester City's revenue was the fifth highest of a
                football club in the world in the 2018–19 season at €568.4
                million.[7] In 2019, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth
                most valuable in the world at $2.69 billion,[8] The club is
                owned by the City Football Group, a British-based[9] holding
                company valued at £3.73 (US$4.8) billion in November 2019
                following a 10% stake sale to Silver Lake

                De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular
                player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian Pro League. In 2012, he
                joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and
                then loaned to Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18
                million in 2014, where he established himself as one of the best
                players in the Bundesliga and was integral in DFB-Pokal win. In
                the summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a club
                record £54 million. He has since won two Premier League titles,
                four League Cups and an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, De
                Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a Premier League
                season and was awarded Player of the Season.

                Raheem Shaquille Sterling (born 8 December 1994) is an English
                professional footballer who plays as a winger and attacking
                midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and the
                England national team. Born in Jamaica, Sterling moved to London
                at the age of five and began his career at Queens Park Rangers
                before signing for Liverpool in 2010. He was awarded the Golden
                Boy award in 2014. In July 2015, following a lengthy dispute
                over a new contract, he was signed by Manchester City in a
                transfer potentially worth £49 million, the highest transfer fee
                ever paid for an English player at the time. He then went on to
                help Manchester City win back-to-back Premier League titles in
                the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons. In the 2018–19 season, he was
                named to the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and won the PFA
                Young Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.
